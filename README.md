# MaximumSumIntervalFromArray
A program that finds the maximum sum interval between two elements in an array A.
The array is read from a text document whose location needs to be input from the console.

The program simply loops through an array, comparing the sum of each two elements.
It handles negatives and improperly set up arrays.
Rouglhy an example for the text doc should be as follows:
Number of whitespaces is irrelevan as long as the digits are seperated.

5
-1     -1 -31 -3 -4

Assignment B
Objective:
Design a program that finds the maximum sum interval in an array A.
The maximum sum interval is defined as the pair of indexes i and j, such as the sum of array 
values A(k), k = i â€¦ j is maximized. 
Design Specification:
The array is read from a text file with the following structure:
- First line contains a single integer value which represents the size of the array N;
- The next line contains N floating-point values; Values are separated by one or more blanks
- The program outputs the start and the end indexes of the area in the array with maximum sum.
Remarks:
- The program should terminate on invalid input;
- Code documentation will be considered a plus.
